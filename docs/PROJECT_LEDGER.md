## 2026-08-04 — Session 1: repository initialisation and v0 vertical slice

**Branch.** `main`
**Stage.** v0 — first working foundation.

**Objective.** Take the repository from a bare README to a functioning compiler for an
AI-native mathematical language, with a frozen semantic contract, executable examples,
tests, and research artefacts sufficient to make the project's central hypothesis
testable.

**Files and systems changed.**

- Repository scaffolded: `pyproject.toml`, `.gitignore`, `LICENSE`, `CLAUDE.md`,
  `README.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `SPEC.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `DECISIONS.md`,
  `CHANGELOG.md`, `SECURITY.md`
- `GOAL.md` written (thesis, three layers, four principles, falsification conditions)
- Semantic kernel: `src/hamiltonian_lang/types.py`, `ast/nodes.py`
- Compiler: `lexer/`, `parser/`, `semantics/`, `type_system/`, `diagnostics/`, `graph/`,
  `cli/`
- Backends: `base.py`, `hml.py`, `canonical.py`, `latex.py`, `english.py` (Lead Architect);
  `stan.py`, `sympy.py`, `lean.py` (Backend Engineer agent)
- Specs: `spec/semantic_objects.yaml`, `type_rules.yaml`, `concept_schema.yaml`,
  `ir.schema.json`
- Examples: seven reference problems plus a quantifier-scope companion file
- Tests: `tests/{parser,semantics,type_system,roundtrip,golden}` (Lead Architect);
  `tests/{backends,adversarial}` (agents)
- Governance: ten agent definitions in `.claude/agents/`, five skills in
  `.claude/skills/`, `.claude/settings.json` hooks, `.githooks/pre-commit`,
  `scripts/conformance.sh`, `scripts/install-git-hooks.sh`, CI workflow

**What was completed.** A full pipeline runs end to end: HML-L1 source parses, resolves,
type-checks, and renders to six views plus a stable content hash. All eight example files
check cleanly. 229 tests pass.

**Decisions made and why.** D-001 to D-013, recorded in `DECISIONS.md`. The four with the
largest consequences:

- **D-003** — distribution arguments are role-labelled and labels are mandatory. Rationale:
  the scale-vs-variance ambiguity is a real, documented source of error. Cost: tokens,
  which H5 will measure rather than assume away.
- **D-004** — the scalar order is a poset, not a chain, because 0 is a probability and is
  not a positive real. `PositiveNatural` was added as the meet of `Natural` and
  `PositiveReal` so the literal `1` can serve as both a count and a scale.
- **D-010** — names are excluded from the content hash. This was forced by a failing
  property test, not chosen up front.
- **D-012** — the claimed contribution was demoted from the representation to the
  experiment, in response to Wave 1 prior-art evidence.

**Agent orchestration.** The master directive specified ten agents; the operator capped
this at four. Roles were merged: prior-art with novelty audit; alphabet with grammar;
backends; benchmarks with adversarial review. The semantics, IR and parser/compiler roles
were executed directly by the Lead Architect because the kernel had to exist before any
other agent could build against it. File ownership was disjoint by construction.
`morphology-architect` was **deferred and not run** — this is a real gap and a
prerequisite for benchmark hypothesis H6.

**Tests and verification actually executed.**

| command | actual result |
|---------|---------------|
| `.venv/bin/pip install -e ".[dev]"` | success |
| `.venv/bin/hml check examples/*/*.hml` | 8/8 clean |
| `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q` | 229 passed |
| `.venv/bin/ruff check` (Lead-Architect files) | All checks passed |
| `.venv/bin/mypy src/hamiltonian_lang` | 1 error in `backends/sympy.py` |
| `./scripts/conformance.sh` | passes except the mypy stage |
| `hml hash` on the two quantifier scopings | hashes differ, as required |

**Failures and unresolved uncertainty.**

- Four real defects were found by running the code and fixed: unary minus preserved a
  positivity refinement (so `const a : Natural = -3` type-checked); `check dimension x = D`
  parsed the assertion as an equation; concept transforms were invisible to invariant
  bodies; declaration names were included in the content hash, breaking alpha-renaming
  invariance. Each is now covered by a test.
- Two defects were reported by the prior-art agent and fixed: `types.py::join` would raise
  `ValueError` on incompatible quantity bases; provenance is claimed in `GOAL.md` and not
  implemented.
- One `mypy` error remains, in an agent-owned file.
- The `linear_regression` example initially failed with "cannot infer a posterior: no
  probability law". The compiler was correct and the example was wrong; the example was
  fixed by adding priors. Recorded because it is the clearest instance of the design
  catching an authoring error.
- **No comparative measurement has been run.** The project's thesis remains untested.

**Effect on the overall project.** The project moves from a prose description to a
falsifiable artefact. The apparatus needed to run the central experiment now exists; the
experiment does not.

**Agent findings integrated after the first draft of this entry.**

- *Prior art.* No structurally novel construct was found in Layer 2. `GOAL.md` was
  corrected in place: Layer 2 is now called "the apparatus", the provenance claim was
  withdrawn, and two falsification conditions were added (out-of-distribution confound;
  Tam et al. EMNLP 2024 on reasoning degradation under format restriction). D-011, D-012.
- *Alphabet and grammar.* The freeze survives measurement across 8 real tokenisers
  (Llama-3 was gated and is excluded rather than estimated). Candidate A scores 115/125.
  Terseness does not pay: candidate B is 36.5% shorter and saves only 3.1% of tokens, and
  loses outright on 4 of 8 tokenisers. 13 of 17 Unicode confusable pairs survive both NFC
  and NFKC. D-014. Two defects in my own freeze document were found and fixed: `rv` was
  missing from the statement list, and the claim that the sd-vs-variance ambiguity "cannot
  be expressed" was **false as written** — the grammar admits it and the type system
  rejects it.
- *Backends.* Stan, SymPy and Lean statement-skeleton backends added, 292 tests. Stan's
  role→position mapping is pinned per family. No example is faithful under any of the
  three, and each backend says so rather than implying fidelity.
- *Red team.* Eight programs that passed `hml check` and should not have. All eight now
  rejected — D-016. The reviewer's use of `xfail(strict=True)` is why every fix was
  noticed immediately: fixing a defect turned its test into a visible failure.

**Corrections to my own work, recorded because they matter.** `semantics/__init__.py`
asserted in a docstring that definition cycles "are detected separately". No such detection
existed. That is worse than a missing feature. It now exists (`HML-S606`). Separately, my
first fix for finding 1.8 rejected any expression carrying `UnknownType`, which made
`require sum(w) = 1.0` a type error — ordinary mathematics the language ought to express.
Replaced with real signatures for the aggregate builtins.

**Verification after integration.**

| command | actual result |
|---------|---------------|
| `.venv/bin/python -m pytest` | **594 passed** (backends 292, golden 84, adversarial 71, roundtrip 50, type_system 39, parser 37, semantics 21) |
| `.venv/bin/ruff check src tests` | All checks passed |
| `.venv/bin/mypy src/hamiltonian_lang` | Success: no issues found in 22 source files |
| `./scripts/conformance.sh` | **CONFORMANCE: PASS**, all 8 stages |
| `.venv/bin/python evaluation/run_baseline.py` | ran; deterministic compiler-side metrics only |

The baseline's generated header previously named three defects that had since been fixed;
the claims were withdrawn and the file regenerated. A stale honest-limitations note is
still a false statement.

**Next intended step.** Build the scaffolding-ablation arm — English plus the same
structural prompting — because it is the arm most likely to falsify the thesis, and
therefore the one that should be built before any arm that could confirm it.

## 2026-08-04 — Session 1, second pass: red-team integration

**Branch.** `main`
**Stage.** v0 — integration of the final Wave 2 agent.

**Objective.** Act on the benchmark and adversarial review agent's report: withdraw
claims it showed were unsupported, and fix the methodological defect that let a false
success criterion pass a green test suite.

**What the agent delivered.** 24 problems across six
categories, 120 arm files, a 620-line preregistered protocol with **seven** arms rather
than five (A' = prose plus a matched structural checklist, E' = comments stripped), and a
deterministic scoring harness reporting 93/93 assertions passed and diagnostic line
accuracy 1.0 over 50 single-line injections. The protocol states plainly that **one
confound is not resolvable**: "structured formal notation helps" cannot be separated from
"*this* notation helps".

Two of my own claims were withdrawn as unsupported:

- `distributions.py` called targeted misparameterisation diagnostics "the clearest single
  demonstration of the project thesis" — a claim about evidence, in a file containing
  none.
- The freeze document's "+4 tokens per law statement, ≈5.9% … measured rather than
  assumed" named no tokeniser and no corpus. The number is real; the citation was missing
  and is now present, together with the fact that `tiktoken` is absent from the project
  venv so `evaluation/score.py`'s own token figures are approximate and not interchangeable
  with it.

**The methodological finding of the session (D-018).** The alpha-renaming success
criterion was **false while a passing property-based test asserted it**. The test was real
and green; its generator simply never produced `def` parameters — the one binder form that
failed. The property is now parameterised over every binder form, with a companion test
asserting each template actually compiles, because a template that silently fails to
compile makes the property vacuously true one level up.

Strengthening that generator immediately produced a further case, which turned out to be a
*design question* rather than a defect: concept parameter names are the concept's
interface, like distribution roles, so renaming one *should* change the hash. The
implementation was already right and the test was wrong. Recorded as D-017 with an explicit
table of which names are binders and which are roles.

**Verification after the second pass.**

| command | actual result |
|---------|---------------|
| `.venv/bin/python -m pytest` | **609 passed** (backends 292, golden 84, adversarial 71, roundtrip 65, type_system 39, parser 37, semantics 21) |
| `./scripts/conformance.sh` | **CONFORMANCE: PASS**, all 8 stages |

**Adopted, not rebutted.** The reviewer's strongest failure argument is now in
`ROADMAP.md`: the inference the thesis wants to eliminate happens when the file is
*written*, not read. A correct-looking encoding of a misunderstanding compiles clean,
hashes correctly, and is wrong. If arm A' closes the gap, the right artefact is a prompt,
not a compiler. That is precisely why A' is built first.

**Files changed.** `DECISIONS.md` (D-017, D-018), `ROADMAP.md`,
`docs/design/V0_DESIGN_FREEZE.md`, `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md`,
`src/hamiltonian_lang/type_system/distributions.py`,
`tests/roundtrip/test_roundtrip.py`, `evaluation/run_baseline.py` and its regenerated
output.

**Effect on the overall project.** The compiler, the benchmark corpus and the
preregistered protocol are now mutually consistent. Two false statements were removed
from the repository. The apparatus is sound; the experiment is still not run.

**Next intended step.** Demonstrate a lossless round trip through a real Layer-3
backend (HML → Stan → HML, HML → Lean → HML) preserving the content hash, or
characterise exactly where it fails. It needs no model call and tests the
one-object-many-views claim directly.

## 2026-08-04 — HML-EVAL-001 §1–2: pre-evaluation audit and version freeze

**Branch.** `main`
**Stage.** HML-EVAL-001, empirical evaluation phase.

**Objective.** Verify repository state directly from commands rather than from prior
summaries, before building any evaluation apparatus on top of it. Freeze v0.

**Files and systems changed.** `docs/evaluation/PRE_EVALUATION_AUDIT.md` (new),
`src/hamiltonian_lang/lexer/__init__.py`, `tests/parser/test_parser.py`, `DECISIONS.md`
(D-019), tag `hml-v0-eval-freeze`.

**What was completed.** A verified inventory: 6 declaration kinds, 5 inference queries,
9 scalar types, 7 base dimensions, 16 distribution families, 9 registered backends, 15
graph edge kinds, 82 diagnostic codes. Commit hashes recorded. Push status confirmed:
both project commits are local-only, verified with `git log --branches --not --remotes`.

**Decisions made and why.** D-019 — the lexer did not terminate on non-ASCII letters.
`str.isalpha()` is true for every Unicode letter, so `ℝ` was dispatched into the identifier
routine, which consumed zero characters; the caller then re-dispatched on the same
character forever. Fixed twice over: ASCII test first in the dispatch, and a zero-progress
guard inside the routine, because a lexer routine must never consume zero input whatever
the dispatch above it believes.

**Tests and verification actually executed.**

| command | actual result |
|---------|---------------|
| `./scripts/conformance.sh` | CONFORMANCE: PASS, all 8 stages |
| `.venv/bin/python -m pytest` | 615 passed (609 before; 6 new regression tests) |
| `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/golden` | 84 passed, no content hash moved |
| round-trip probe over 9 backends | 1 re-parses and preserves the hash; 8 do not |
| `curl localhost:11434/v1/chat/completions` | gemma4:31b generating, 638 completion tokens in 25.7s |

**Failures and unresolved uncertainty.**

- The audit **contradicted a convenient reading of my own earlier summaries**. "Nine
  backends" invites the reading that nine translations exist. Nine *renderings* exist. The
  count of demonstrated semantics-preserving round trips is **one**, HML → HML, which is
  the trip that cannot lose anything. Corrected in the audit and in `PROJECT_STATUS.md`.
- `BackendResult.faithful` is a weaker claim than its name suggests: it means "declared no
  per-construct loss", not "round-trips". Four backends report `faithful=True` while being
  one-way.
- D-019 was found only because the audit *tested* the round-trip claim instead of trusting
  it. Had it not been found, the first model output containing `ℝ` or `∀` would have hung
  the run with no timeout and no diagnostic — destroying the experiment silently rather
  than failing it loudly.
- The available model is a **reasoning model**. It decomposes problems internally
  regardless of arm, which biases the A vs A′ contrast towards the null and therefore
  biases any Hamiltonian-over-A′ result in the thesis's favour. Recorded before any data
  exists.
- Measured throughput 26 s/call makes the full 120 × 7 × 3 design ≈18.2 hours. The
  apparatus will be built to specification; the run will be a preregistered subset, and
  unrun cells will be reported as unrun rather than quietly dropped.

**Effect on the overall project.** The project's factual base is now verified rather than
asserted, and one defect that would have invalidated the experiment has been removed.

**Next intended step.** Build the canonical semantic source dataset, so that all seven arms
are rendered from one object rather than authored independently — which is what prevents
one arm from silently carrying more information than another.
